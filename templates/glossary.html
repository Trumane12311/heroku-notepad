                  <li><strong>Steel</strong>: The original rollercoaster. The worldâ€™s first wooden rollercoaster opened to the public in 1804 in Paris, France. Most wooden rollercoasters have running rails made of flattened steel strips mounted on a laminated wooden track. Many wooden rollercoasters have wooden support structures, but not all. In some cases, steel supports and trusses are also used.</li>
                  <br>
                  <li><strong>Wood</strong>: The modern rollercoaster. Steel rollercoasters run on tracks made entirely of tubular steel and have steel support structures. The worldâ€™s first steel rollercoaster was opened in Disneyland Park in 1959. The introduction of steel tracks revolutionised the industry and was the most significant change to rollercoaster design since the 1800s.</li>
                  <br>
                  <li><strong>Hybrid</strong>: Hold on to your hats, everyone. The new generation of rollercoasters is officially here. Hybrid rollercoasters combine smooth steel tracks with traditional wooden structures, giving riders all the fun of the â€˜wooden wobbleâ€™, with a far smoother, less bumpy ride.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Sit Down</strong>: The traditional coaster design, with riders sitting inside a car.
                    </li>
                <br>
                    <li><strong>Inverted</strong>: Coaster in which the train runs under the track with the seats directly attached to the wheel carriage. This latter attribute is what sets it apart from the older suspended coaster, which runs under the track, but swings via a pivoting bar attached to the wheel carriage. Inverted coasters are notable for their reversed orientation compared to a traditional roller coaster, with the legs rather than the arms exposed.
                    </li>
                <br>
                    <li><strong>Suspended</strong>: Coaster using trains which travel beneath the track and pivot on a swinging arm from side to side, exaggerating the track's banks and turns.</li>
                <br>
                    <li><strong>Wing</strong>: Coaster differs from many traditional steel roller coasters in that its trains are not located above or below the track but rather on the sides, a configuration that gives riders the impression of free flight.</li>
                <br>
                    <li><strong>Flying</strong>: Coaster is meant to simulate the sensations of flight by harnessing riders in a prone position during the duration of the ride. The roller coaster cars are suspended below the track, with riders secured such that their backs are parallel to the track.</li>
                <br>
                    <li><strong>Stand-Up</strong>: Coaster features trains with cars that are ridden in a standing position. These rides are generally very intense and often carry a higher height restriction than most roller coasters.</li>
                <br>
                    <li><strong>Bobsled</strong>: Coaster that uses a track design that is essentially a "pipe" with the top half removed and has cars that are sent down this pipe in a freewheeling mode. The name derives from the great similarity to the track design used for the winter sport of bobsleigh.</li>
                <br>
                    <li><strong>Pipeline</strong>: Coaster model where the trains ride between the tracks as opposed to a traditional roller coaster where they ride above them. The concept was first developed by Japanese ride company TOGO, and was known as the Ultra Twister.</li>
